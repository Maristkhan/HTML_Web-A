      <h3> Coding in a CSS Navigation Bar.</h3>
      <p> When clicking on a website, a navigation bar is a really useful tool to have so that users can easily head to a different link.</p>
      <p> So on this page, you'll learn how to add a CSS Navigation bar to your website. </p> <br>

      <p> Before you start this lesson, make sure you already have 1 or 2 HTML files that you've created ready, like the file you would have created in Part 1. If you need help making these files, head to Part 1 to learn how to create a HTML file. </p>
      <p> In order to go to Part 1, all you need to do is click Pt_1 on the top of the page, second on the nav bar. </p>
      <p> This file should be set up, ready for code. If you need help setting the file up, head to Part 2 to set the file up. </p>
      <p> In order to go to Part 2, all you need to do is click Pt_2 on the top of the page, third on the nav bar.</p>
      <p> When you're working on your website, you'll need to know how to open it onto your web browser. If you need help opening your website in a web browser, head to Part 2. </p>
      <p> Once you have finished, you may continue onwards. </p><br><br>

      <p> The Css Navigation Bar is a step that will include using the space between 'head' and '/head', but will begin with using the space between 'body' and '/body'. </p>
      <p> W3Schools, last on the Css Nav bar, gives you the code, explaining parts of the code before showing the code as a whole. </p>
      <p> This guide will go over the 3 pages of the Css Navigation Bar, to give more information for beginners and help those who have trouble with executing this code. </p><br>

      <h4> Page 1, Navbar. </h4>
      <p> On the first code, it gives the user the practical pieces of the nav bar, allowing others to move from one URL to another. </p>
      <p> This code belongs within the 'body', as it is the functioning part of the nav bar. </p>
      <p> The code works exactly like how links do from Pt_2, third on the CSS Nav Bar. The link is written within the quotation marks, and what you want the user to see in your website should be typed in the space between the end of the code 'href' and '/a'. </p><br>

      <p> The second code belongs within the 'head', since it serves to change visual aspects of the practical code on the website. </p>
      <p> If you feel interested, you can experiment with different values from the given code, to see for yourself what they do. </p><br><br>

      
      <h4> Page 2, Vertical Navbar. </h4>
      <p> All the code that is given here should be place within the 'head', as they all function to change the appearance of the nav bar. </p>
      <p> If you feel interested, you can experiment with different values from the given code, to see for yourself what they do. </p><br><br>


      <h4> Page 3, Horizontal Navbar. </h4>
      <p> All the code given here other than Right-Align Links belong within 'head'. </p>
      <p> Depending on what you want your nav bar to work, you can try using any of the codes from any of the 3 pages from W3schools. </p>
      <p> If you feel interested, you can experiment with different values from the given code, or use 2 or more codes with different functionality to see for yourself what they'll do. </p><br>

      <p> Once you're done, you'll have a HTML website with a CSS Navigation bar, allowing others to easily connect to linked websites. </p> 
      <p> For some extra code to make your website look nicer, click on Pt_6, seventh on the CSS Nav Bar. </p> <br> <br> <br>
